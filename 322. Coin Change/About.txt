Intuition:
The intuition behind the solution is to use dynamic programming to build up the solution incrementally. The `dp` array is used to store the fewest number of coins needed to make up each amount from 0 to the target amount. By iteratively considering each coin denomination and updating the `dp` array, the algorithm finds the minimum number of coins needed for each amount.

Approach:
1. Create an array `dp` of size `amount + 1` and initialize all elements to `amount + 1`, except `dp[0]` which is initialized to 0. This ensures that the minimum number of coins needed to make up an amount is initially set to a large value (amount + 1) for all amounts except 0.
2. Iterate over each coin denomination in the `coins` array.
3. For each coin denomination, iterate from that coin's value to the target amount (i.e., from `coin` to `amount`).
4. For each amount `i`, update `dp[i]` to the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - coin] + 1`. This means considering the possibility of using the current coin denomination and adding one more coin to the solution.
5. After iterating through all coin denominations and amounts, the final value of `dp[amount]` will represent the minimum number of coins needed to make up the target amount.
6. If `dp[amount]` is still equal to `amount + 1`, it means it was not possible to make up the target amount, so return -1. Otherwise, return `dp[amount]` as the minimum number of coins.

Complexity:
- The time complexity of this approach is O(coins.length * amount) because it involves nested loops over the coins array and amounts up to the target amount.
- The space complexity is O(amount) since the `dp` array is used to store the minimum number of coins for each amount.
