# Intuition - 
The intuition behind the Prime Number Checker program is to determine whether a given number is prime or not. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The program takes a number as input and checks whether it satisfies this condition.

# Approach - 
1. The program first takes an input number from the user.
2. It checks if the number is less than or equal to 1. If it is, the program outputs that the number is not prime.
3. Otherwise, it iterates from 2 to the square root of the input number (inclusive).
4. For each iteration, it checks if the current number divides the input number evenly (i.e., if there is no remainder when the input number is divided by the current number). If the condition is satisfied, the program outputs that the number is not prime.
5. If no divisor is found, the program concludes that the input number is prime and outputs the result accordingly.

# Complexity - 
The time complexity of the Prime Number Checker program can be analyzed as follows:
1. Taking input and initializing variables takes constant time, O(1).
2. Checking if the number is less than or equal to 1 takes constant time, O(1).
3. The iteration from 2 to the square root of the input number takes approximately O(sqrt(n)) iterations, where n is the input number.
4. For each iteration, the program performs a modulus operation, which takes constant time, O(1).
5. Overall, the time complexity of the program can be considered as O(sqrt(n)), where n is the input number.

The space complexity of the program is O(1) because it only uses a fixed amount of memory to store the input and a few variables regardless of the input size.
