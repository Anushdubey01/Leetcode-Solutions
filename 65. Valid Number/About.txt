# Intuition - 
- The code is checking if a given string represents a valid number.
- It uses a set of boolean variables to keep track of certain conditions and patterns within the string.
- The code iterates through the characters of the string and performs specific checks based on the encountered character.

# Approach - 
1. Trim the input string to remove leading and trailing spaces.
2. If the trimmed string is empty, return false since an empty string cannot represent a valid number.
3. Initialize boolean variables: seenNum, seenDot, and seenE to keep track of different components of a number.
4. Iterate through each character of the string using a for loop.
5. Check the character using a switch statement and perform specific actions based on the character encountered:
   - If a dot is encountered:
     - If a dot has already been seen or an 'e' has been seen before, return false since multiple dots or dots after 'e' are not allowed.
     - Set seenDot to true.
   - If an 'e' or 'E' is encountered:
     - If 'e' or 'E' has already been seen or no digit has been seen before, return false.
     - Set seenE to true and seenNum to false.
   - If a '+' or '-' is encountered:
     - If it is not the first character and the previous character is not 'e', return false since '+' or '-' should only appear at the start or after 'e'.
     - Set seenNum to false.
   - For any other character:
     - If it is not a digit, return false.
     - Set seenNum to true.
6. After the loop, return the value of seenNum.
   - If at least one digit has been seen, it means the string represents a valid number, so return true.
   - Otherwise, return false.

# Complexity - 
- The code has a Time Complexity of **O(n),** where n is the length of the input string. This is because it iterates through each character of the string once.
- The space complexity is **O(1)** since the code uses a fixed set of boolean variables and does not require additional data structures that grow with the input size.
