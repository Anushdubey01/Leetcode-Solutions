Intuition:
The program checks whether a given number 'n' is fascinating or not. A fascinating number is a number that, when multiplied by 2 and 3, can be concatenated with the original number to form a 9-digit number that contains all digits from 1 to 9 exactly once.

Approach:
1. Convert the given number 'n' to a string and concatenate it with '2n' and '3n' to form a new string called 'concatenated'.
2. Check if the length of the 'concatenated' string is not equal to 9. If it is not, return false since a fascinating number should always have 9 digits.
3. Create a set called 'digits' to store the unique digits in the 'concatenated' string.
4. Iterate through each character in the 'concatenated' string.
    - If the character is '0', return false since '0' is not allowed in the fascinating number.
    - Add each character to the 'digits' set.
5. Iterate from 1 to 9 and check if each digit exists in the 'digits' set. If any digit is missing, return false.
6. If all digits are present and the previous conditions are satisfied, return true.

Complexity:
- The conversion of the integer 'n' to a string takes O(log n) time.
- Concatenating the three strings takes O(1) time since the total length is fixed.
- Checking the length of the 'concatenated' string and adding characters to the 'digits' set both take O(1) time.
- The iteration over the 'concatenated' string takes O(1) time since the length is fixed.
- The iteration from 1 to 9 also takes O(1) time since the range is fixed.
- Overall, the time complexity of the program is O(log n).
- The space complexity is O(1) since the set 'digits' contains at most 9 elements, which is a constant.
