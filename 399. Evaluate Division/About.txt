Intuition:
The given code implements a solution to calculate the division results for a set of equations using a graph-based approach. The equations are provided as a list of pairs, where each pair represents a division operation. The values array contains the corresponding results for each division. The queries list contains pairs of values for which the division results need to be calculated. The code constructs a graph where each node represents a variable, and the edges represent the division relationship between variables. Then, it performs a depth-first search (DFS) on the graph to find the division result for each query.

Approach:
1. Create a HashMap called `graph` to represent the division relationships between variables. The key of the map is a string representing a variable, and the value is another map. The nested map represents the adjacent variables and their corresponding division values.
2. Construct the graph by iterating through the equations list. For each equation, obtain the numerator (`A`) and denominator (`B`) variables. Add `A` and `B` as keys to the graph if they don't exist already. Then, update the division values for both `A` and `B` in the graph.
3. Iterate through the queries list. For each query, obtain the numerator (`A`) and denominator (`C`) variables. Check if both `A` and `C` exist in the graph. If not, set the corresponding answer in the `ans` array to -1.0.
4. If `A` and `C` exist in the graph, call the `divide` function to calculate the division result recursively. The `divide` function takes the graph, numerator (`A`), denominator (`C`), and a set `seen` to track visited nodes during the DFS.
5. In the `divide` function, check if `A` is equal to `C`. If they are the same variable, return 1.0 since any number divided by itself is 1.0.
6. Add `A` to the `seen` set to mark it as visited.
7. Iterate through the adjacent variables (`B`) of `A` in the graph. If `B` is already visited (in the `seen` set), skip it to avoid cycles in the graph.
8. Recursively call the `divide` function with the adjacent variable `B` and the denominator `C`. Store the result in the `res` variable.
9. If the result (`res`) is greater than 0, it means a valid division result was found. Multiply the division value from `A` to `B` (`graph.get(A).get(B)`) with the result (`res`) to get the division value from `A` to `C`. Return this value.
10. If no valid result is found, return -1.0 to indicate an invalid division.

Complexity Analysis:
- Let n be the total number of equations and m be the total number of queries.
- Constructing the graph takes O(n) time, as it iterates through the equations list and performs constant-time operations for each equation.
- For each query, the `divide` function performs a DFS on the graph. In the worst case, it visits all nodes in the graph, resulting in a time complexity of O(n). Since there are m queries, the overall time complexity for all queries is O(n * m).
- The space complexity is O(n) to store the graph and O(m) to store the `ans` array.
