Intuition:
The problem requires finding the shortest path to collect all the keys in a grid-based maze. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore the maze and find the shortest path.

Approach:
1. Initialize variables to store the dimensions of the grid, the bitmask representing all the keys, and the starting position.
2. Iterate through the grid to find the starting position and count the total number of keys, updating the bitmask accordingly.
3. Create a queue to perform BFS, and a 3D visited array to keep track of visited states.
4. Add the initial state (starting position and bitmask of collected keys) to the queue and mark it as visited.
5. Initialize a variable to keep track of the number of steps taken.
6. While the queue is not empty, process each state in the queue:
   - Expand the current state by exploring in all four directions (up, down, left, right).
   - Check if the expanded state has collected all the keys. If so, return the number of steps taken.
   - If the expanded position is a wall, skip it.
   - If the expanded position is a key, update the bitmask of collected keys.
   - If the expanded position is a lock and the corresponding key has not been collected, skip it.
   - If the expanded position is a valid position and has not been visited with the same bitmask, add it to the queue and mark it as visited.
7. If it's not possible to collect all keys, return -1.

Complexity:
- The time complexity of the solution is O(m * n * 2^k), where m is the number of rows, n is the number of columns, and k is the number of keys in the maze.
- The space complexity is O(m * n * 2^k) for the visited array and the queue.
