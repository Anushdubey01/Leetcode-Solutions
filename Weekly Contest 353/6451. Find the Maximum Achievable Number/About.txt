Intuition:
The program aims to find the maximum achievable number by applying a certain operation to the given number `num` for a maximum of `t` times.

Approach:
1. Initialize the maximum achievable number `maxAchievable` as `num + 2*t`. This is because we can increase or decrease `num` by 1 a maximum of `t` times in either direction.
2. Return `maxAchievable` as the maximum achievable number.

Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: The time complexity of this program is O(1) because it performs a constant number of operations.
- Space Complexity: The space complexity is also O(1) as it only requires a constant amount of space to store the `maxAchievable` variable.

The program simply calculates the maximum achievable number based on the given inputs. It doesn't involve any complex logic or computations.
