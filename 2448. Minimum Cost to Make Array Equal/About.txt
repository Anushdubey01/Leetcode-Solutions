Intuition:
The goal of the program is to find the minimum cost required to modify the numbers in the "nums" array to a target value. Each number can be modified independently, and the cost of modifying a number depends on its difference from the target value and the corresponding cost value in the "cost" array.

Approach:
1. Find the lowest and highest numbers in the "nums" array using the `min()` and `max()` methods from the `Arrays` class.
2. Use binary search to find the target value that results in the minimum cost. Initialize the lower bound (`lowestNum`) as the lowest number and the upper bound (`highestNum`) as the highest number.
3. In each iteration, calculate the cost for the middle value (`mid`) of the current range using the `calculateCost()` method.
4. Also, calculate the cost for the next value after the middle value (`mid + 1`).
5. Compare the two costs and update the minimum cost (`minimumCost`) accordingly.
6. Adjust the range by updating the lower bound (`lowestNum`) or the upper bound (`highestNum`) based on the comparison of the costs.
7. Repeat steps 3-6 until the lower bound becomes equal to or greater than the upper bound.
8. Return the minimum cost.

Complexity:
- Finding the lowest and highest numbers takes O(N) time, where N is the length of the "nums" array.
- Binary search is performed on the range of numbers, which takes O(log N) iterations.
- For each iteration, calculating the cost takes O(N) time.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity of the program is O(N log N).
- The space complexity is O(1) as the program uses a constant amount of additional space for variables.
