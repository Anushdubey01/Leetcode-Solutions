# Intuition - 
The code aims to determine whether a given graph is bipartite or not. A bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects a vertex from one set to the other. The code uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the graph and assign states to each node to check if it can be part of a bipartite graph.

# Approach - 
1. Initialize an array `states` to keep track of the state assigned to each node. A state of 0 represents an unvisited node, 1 represents being in one set, and -1 represents being in the other set.
2. Iterate through each node in the graph.
3. If the state of the current node is non-zero, continue to the next iteration.
4. Call the `dfs` function with the current node, assigning the state of 1. If the `dfs` function returns `false`, it means that the current node or its adjacent nodes violate the bipartite condition, and the graph is not bipartite. Return `false`.
5. If all nodes have been visited and the bipartite condition is satisfied for each node, return `true` indicating that the graph is bipartite.

The `dfs` function:
1. If the state of the current node is non-zero, return `true` if it matches the expected state (based on the bipartite condition), or `false` otherwise.
2. If the current node has no adjacent nodes, return `true` as it doesn't affect the bipartite condition.
3. Assign the state to the current node based on the bipartite condition.
4. Iterate through each adjacent node of the current node.
5. Recursively call the `dfs` function with the adjacent node, assigning the opposite state (-state) and check if it returns `false`. If it does, return `false` indicating the violation of the bipartite condition.
6. If all adjacent nodes satisfy the bipartite condition, return `true`.

# Complexity Analysis - 
- The code iterates through each node in the graph once, so the time complexity of the `isBipartite` function is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the graph.
- The `dfs` function is called once for each node, and within each call, it iterates through the adjacent nodes. In the worst case, each edge is visited once, resulting in a time complexity of O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.
- The space complexity is O(n) for storing the `states` array and the recursive stack for DFS, where n is the number of nodes in the graph.
