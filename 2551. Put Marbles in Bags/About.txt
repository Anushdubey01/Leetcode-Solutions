Intuition:
The goal of this code is to distribute k marbles among adjacent pairs of weights. Each adjacent pair has a combined weight, and the marbles need to be distributed in such a way that the difference between the total weight of the pairs with the fewest marbles and the total weight of the pairs with the most marbles is minimized.

Approach:
1. Create a new array A with a length of weights.length - 1. This array will store the sum of weights for each adjacent pair.
2. Initialize two variables, min and max, to 0. These variables will represent the minimum and maximum total weights of the pairs after distributing the marbles.
3. Calculate the sum of weights for each adjacent pair and store it in array A.
4. Sort array A in ascending order.
5. Iterate from i = 0 to k - 1 and do the following:
   a. Add the i-th element of array A to min.
   b. Add the (A.length - 1 - i)-th element of array A to max.
6. Return the difference between max and min.

Complexity Analysis:
- The code has a time complexity of O(n log n) because of the sorting operation performed on array A.
- Here, n represents the length of the weights array.
- The space complexity is O(n) because of the auxiliary array A used to store the sums of adjacent pairs.
